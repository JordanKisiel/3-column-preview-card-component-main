## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first site that I developed where I utilized a mobile-first approach. This was mainly as an experiment to see how it felt and I found it to be much more intuitive and natural than a desktop-first approach. Mobile-first always made sense to me intellectually (as desktop will almost always add complexity and it's more natural to add complexity than remove it) but it took me a while to try it out simply because I was used to only developing for desktop.

### Continued development

This is the third project I've done with the same basic layout idea (a centered box) and I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on how to tackle this sort of design. I'd like to move on to either something more complex or, at the very least, different. I also intend to continue practicing a mobile-first approach.
